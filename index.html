        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is one of the three cornerstone languages used in web development: HTML, CSS, and JS.</li>
          <li>HTML is used to create the structure of a webpage. </li>
          <li>HTML is made up of ELEMENTS and an element is a type of content on a webpage. </li>
          <li>HTML elements work together to build the structure of a webpage and provide a framework that makes it easy for a user to navigate the webpage.</li>
          <li>Two elements are especially important to understanding how the structure works: the HEAD and the BODY.</li>
          <li>The HEAD element contains information, or metadata, that helps the browser to render the page correctly. Metadata is data about our webpage that the browser uses to effectively serve our webpage to users. Elements included within the HEAD are not visible when a user looks at a webpage.</li>
          <li>The BODY element defines the body of the document, which contains the content that is visible to the user. All the elements that we want the user to see and interact with must be placed inside this element.</li>
          <li>The BODY element is an example of a semantic HTML element. It is important to use semantic HTML elements, because they make your HTML easier to read by other developers and the browser and more accessible to a variety of users (assistive technologies).</li>
          <li>An HTML ATTRIBUTE defines additional information about an element.</li>
          <li>An element refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag, whereas a TAG refers only to what appears inside the angle brackets.</li>
          <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called CHILD ELEMENTS. The element that holds all the children is known as the PARENT ELEMENT.</li>
          <li>The ALT TEXT is important for screen readers and other assistive technologies. Alt text can also improve search engine rankings for your website.</li>
          <li>SECTION elements are semantic elements that define a section in a document that contains thematic content.</li>
        </ul>
